# Mapping Earthquakes


The purpose of this project is to plot Earthquake data onto a map presented in a web browser. Mapbox and Leaflet are the primary tools used for this project. Earthquakes are plotted as a scatterplot with the size and color of the circle representing the magnitude of the Earthquake (legend is provided). Map can be toggled between street, satellite, and light modes.
